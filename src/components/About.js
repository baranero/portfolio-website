          I am a firefighter and designer of fire protection systems. I know from experience how to work with a client, how to properly manage a project and how to meet deadlines. I also work well in a team and get along with every member. I have no commercial experience in programming, but programming has become my passion and I devote every free moment to learning. As a beginner, I don't have any salary requirements, I just want to prove my worth as a developer.
